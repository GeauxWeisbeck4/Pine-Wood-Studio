## Pine Wood Studio - Full-Stack 11ty Development

When this company was created, I needed a simple, fast, and accessible framework that has a thriving community in order to make our brand more well known. The choice actually never really was in doubt - I chose my favorite static site generator.

I'd like y'all to meet [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), the SSG that gives you the freedom to template websites and apps however the user likes. Eleventy is great because it is simple, powerful, written in javascript, and framework free.

My next step in deciding the core technologies for developing, editing and creating content for Pine Wood Studios was well thought through, but again, I already knew which deployment platform and git-powered CMS I would need to put smiles on the faces of my clients. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and their suite of tools allow you to accomplish anything with Jamstack. They've created other great projects such as New Relic and Jamstack Explorers. Super fun stuff.

## Web Dev Chemistry

At the Pine Wood Studio office, you will find constant innovation, different mixture of CMSs, functions and tools - the best part is we have no idea what we have the potential to even create yet. As the owner, I know that I have already created some awesome stuff with 11ty and am only getting started.

Web Dev Chemistry is about finding that perfect combination of a tech stack (usually Jamstack, mind you) for each and every client so that every business owner and their customers truly love the app or website they interact with. There is no amount of money that can replace the smile of a satisfied customer - we offer pretty fair pricing with our "Always Willing to Work With You" policy which means that let's make sure we take of you before worrying about money.

#### Please don't abuse this policy

You will only hurt yourself and you will make me not trust people for five seconds. For real though, you won't stop me from helping out others when they need it. But I also have bills to pay and this can be hard work.

## Thank You From Pine Wood Owner Andrew

First of all, I must thank Tyler M Roderick for creating this incredibl theme - please check his them out and give it a star on his [Github repo](https://github.com/TylerMRoderick/fernfolio-11ty-template). He's so kind to even provide you with customization instructions [here](/posts/theme-customizations/).

[Pine in Hand](/static/img/fern-in-hand.jpeg 'Fern in Hand') unfortunately has to replace the Fern in Hand to represent our brand. The pine tree represents a fresh and beautiful experience that we give to each and every client we have the privilege to serve.

I say we but the truth is this is a one man show right now, owned and operated by [Andrew Weisbeck aka GeauxWeisbeck4](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev). While I do love getting to have a hand in every project, I am going to hire other people and give them the opportunity to work with 11ty and other awesome technologies while getting paid.

Even though I'm not advertising for help, please do ask - I will keep you on a list and may even pay for small tasks that I need help with. I am building a [Jamstack Community for Developers](https://jamstackcommunity.dev) and want to help Jamstack Devs find new opportunities.

I hope you learned a bit about my newest 11ty agency and really hope you decide to do business with Pine Wood Studio. I promise you will be satisfied with what we create together.
