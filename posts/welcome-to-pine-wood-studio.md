Pine Wood Studio was created specifically to develop websites and apps using the Eleventy static site generator. I became interested in Eleventy when I first started learning [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) at the beginning of 2022 and have come full circle back to where I started and am now launching an 11ty Dev Agency to offer my full-stack web development services.

## Pine Wood Studio: A Fresh Developer Studio

Pine Wood Studio is a full-stack 11ty Dev Agency located in Raleigh, NC. After discovering the Eleventy Super Professional Business Network and my love for 11ty, I decided to create Pine Wood Studio and offer full-stack web development, marketing services, and graphic design to the 11ty community. I will also have courses, with some being free and others paid and will have a live coding course in the near future.

### Andrew Weisbeck - About the Owner

I am a 31 year old full-stack developer who came across Jamstack at the end of 2021 - Jamstack wasn't new to me, I just hadn't actually tried it yet as I was heavily into Python at the time. The pandemic was rough for me as my first company, WeisMind Consulting, didn't make it through the pandemic. Not too long after that, I lost my job at SunTrust Bank.

I really jumped into full-stack development during the pandemic and also met my fiance Lisa - so it wasn't all bad. Well it kind of was as I only worked 6 months during the entire pandemic as I struggled to find work. I had applied for over 1,000 jobs (not even joking) before I finally said, "You know what? I love coding and am just gonna be a Freelance Full-Stack Developer." Part of it was nobody would hire me and the other part was that it would be really cool to create cool websites all the time.

### Let's Do Business!

When I learned that there was a [Super Professional Business Network](https://www.11ty.dev/super-professional-business-network/) within the 11ty Community, I couldn't wait to create a brand and get my own agency listed on the site! Eleventy is the first SSG I ever tried out and I fell in love with it right away. While I love 11ty and it is my favorite community that I am a part of, I do have many other SSGs that I utilize in order to have my business spread across more markets.

- Full Stack Web & App Development
