## Building a Sick Website With A11pine Forestry

I was thinking about creating a starter project right when I was starting the Pine Wood Studio brand while also ironically playing around with the Forestry CMS and Alpine.js and it didn't take too long for it dawn on me that I had my perfect template right in front of me! The project fits Pine Wood Studio too well or I am just crazy about pine trees - living in Montana and North Carolina will do that to you.

## Getting Started - Installing the Dependencies

Just so you know, you always have the option to change any of the technology that is being used. But since you are reading this and have the A11Pine Forestry starter, then I am going to assume that you like the tech stack that is available.

```text/2-3
// Install the dependencies in package.json
$ cd 11Alpine-Forestry
$ npm install
```

We have now just installed Bulma, Alpine.js, and the Forestry CMS. We now need to add some configuration files into our project to make sure everything is running smoothly. They should have already been added, but just make sure your files look like just like the files below.
