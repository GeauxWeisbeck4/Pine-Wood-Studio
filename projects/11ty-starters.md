## 11ty Starters and Website Examples

The [starters on 11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) are perfect: not too much of a theme and also not too little direction on how to build. This is the reason why I learned Jamstack so quickly - because I read through the 11ty documentation and created projects with the 11ty starters. The starters are great and there are also a bunch of awesome [11ty tutorials](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/tutorials/) that teach you the basics and then some.

The [11ty community](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/community/) has 544 developers that are active within the community at this time. There are plenty of developers that know how to build with Eleventy and they even have a [Super Professional Business Network](https://www.11ty.dev/super-professional-business-network/) where you can hire an 11ty Developer who have a lot of experience - such as Pine Wood Studio! Hire any of us 11ty Developers for both personal and professional projects.

### 11ty Starters and Websites

- [Pine Wood Studio Agency Site](https://pinewoodstudio.agency): Created with 11ty and the Fernfolio Starter. Yes I included this site because I want to show the power of 11ty Starter Projects.

- [11Forestry Starter](https://11forestrystarter.netlify.app): This was the first Starter Project I created for the 11ty Community. 11ty paired with a git-based CMS, [Forestry](https://forestry.io) which makes for a powerful blogging or documentation setup. Also suggests [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and Post CSS to keep solution lightweight, but provide freedom for you to choose your own CSS.

-[ElevenTina ](https://ElevenTina.netlify.app): ElevenTina is a starter that is currently in progress and is nearly ready to share with the community. Y'all should have fun with this one!
