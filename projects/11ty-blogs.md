## 11ty Blog Websites

My personal blog website, [andrewweisbeck.blog](andrewweisbeck.blog) uses 11ty and Netlify CMS to make it easy to write and publish posts. My website is used for fun but many people use this for their blogging solution and love it. You can find the various [11ty blogs](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev) that I have developed and/or sold.

### Content Mangement System

A good content management system is important for collaboration for developers and non-developers alike. Pine Wood Studio often pairs 11ty with the Netlify CMS for writing blog posts and creating new pages quickly. It is one of the more intuitive and less technical content management systems that are in the Jamstack ecosystem.

There are different use cases for other CMSs as well and Pine Wood Studio utilizes many different CMS solutions depending on the use case. [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io) and [CosmicJS](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) are two other CMSs that we often use, especially for other applications.

### CSS Frameworks

Pine Wood Studio often uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) because of it's ease of use and it is requested by clients a lot. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is another framework that we love to use for more standard website solutions. Using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) is the preferred solution for bigger projects that require larger components so that blog sites can perform better. Again, Pine Wood Studio works with many different frameworks

### Current and Past Projects

Here are some current and previous 11ty blogs that have been created by Pine Wood Studio:
